# MIT-Intro-to-Computer-Science-and-Python

This repository stores my solutions for problem sets and exercises for the MIT 6.00.1x course. 

The course is a general introduction to computer science and computation. 
Python is the only programming language used in this class. 

Topics include (amongst others):
- Computation
- Common algorithms
- Functions
- Debugging
- Efficiency and Orders of Growth
- Memory and Search
- Classes and Object Oriented Programming

Solutions have the problem set questions and notes commented directly into them.
